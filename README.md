# Lab code repository
The aim of this repository is to have a centralized place to share and develop
utilities that could be of use to other lab members. In this sense, it is a
mixed code repository that does not have a specific functionality. If, within
it, some tool grows enough to have an entity of its own, it may be eventually
moved to its own repository.

## Structure of the repository
The repository is (will be) structured as follows:

- `notebooks`: R and possibly python notebooks that either explain functionality
    available on this repository or useful analyses that can be done within
    the context of our lab, even if they do not represent additional code
    development.
- `snippets`: Pieces of code that are useful to share but do not fit (yet) in a
    library/R package/tool. These can come or have a GitHub gist attached to
    them.
- `doc`: Documentation.
- `elsasserlib`: Mixed utils R package that contains code that can be useful to
    perform usual analyses in the lab.

## Including code in the repo
If you have some code you think it may be useful for the lab, you're welcome to
include it! If it does not match any category in the proposed structure above,
we can of course include new things.

If you are familiar with how GitHub works, you are welcome to add a pull request
with your code!

In order to be somewhat consistent, I ask you to follow the same style as the 
code that is already there. Mostly, I follow the conventions stated in the
tidyverse style guide: https://style.tidyverse.org/ which seemed reasonable
enough.


## Wishlists, suggestions and bug reports also welcome
Please, add issues to the repository if you encounter any problems or you have
suggestions or wishes about functionalities to add. If you are unsure about how
to do any of this, feel free to talk to me :)
