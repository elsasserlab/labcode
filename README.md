# Test repository
The aim of this repository is mainly to have a centralized place to share and develop utilities that could be of use to other lab members. In this sense, it is a mixed code repository that does not have a specific functionality. If, within it, some tool grows enough to have an entity of its own, it may be eventually moved to its own repository.

## Structure of the repository
The repository is structured as follows:

- `notebooks`: R and possibly python notebooks that either explain functionality available on this repository or useful analyses that can be done within the context of our lab, even if they do not represent additional code development.
- `snippets`: Pieces of code that are useful to share but do not fit (yet) in a library/R package/tool. These can come or hava a GitHub gist attached to them.
- `doc`: Documentation.
- `elsasserlib`: Mixed utils R package that contains code that can be useful to perform usual analyses in the lab.
