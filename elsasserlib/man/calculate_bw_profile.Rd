\title{Mean coverage of a BigWig list of files on a set of loci specified as BED file.}
\usage{
calculate_bw_profile(
  bw,
  gr,
  bg_bw = NULL,
  label = NULL,
  mode = "stretch",
  bin = 100,
  upstream = 2500,
  downstream = 2500,
  ignore_strand = F,
  norm_func = identity
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bw}{BigWig file to be summarized.}

\item{gr}{GRanges object}

\item{bg_bw}{BigWig file to be used as background}

\item{label}{Name to give to the values}

\item{mode}{How to handle differences in lengths across loci:
stretch: Anchor each locus on both sides.
start: Anchor all loci on start.
end: Anchor all loci on end.
center: Center all loci.}

\item{bin}{Bin size. Length of bin in base pairs. The lower, the higher the resolution.}

\item{upstream}{Number of base pairs to include upstream of loci.}

\item{downstream}{Number of base pairs to include downstream of loci.}

\item{ignore_strand}{Whether to use strand information in BED file.}

\item{norm_func}{Function to be applied after normalizing: norm_func(bw/bg).}
}
\value{
A DataFrame with the aggregated scores
